<h3>Applied Machine Learning</h3>
Fall 2025

<p><b>Overview: </b> Machine learning has been critical in the field of artificial intelligence, which has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years. It refers to a set of statistical tools used to solve a wide array of learning problems. This course focuses on the application, practical use, and ethical considerations of machine learning models and learning methodologies. You will learn how to formulate problems, gather data, train and evaluate models, taking design considerations into account. This course will cover important theoretical concepts but will not go in-depth into machine learning theory.</p>

<p>Topics include how to train and evaluate models, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, linear models, neural networks, crowdsourcing, bias and fairness, explainability, generative models. Assignments and lectures will focus on the Python language and will require programming background. Practices and developments will be discussed with practical exercises.<p>

<p><b>Books: </b>The following books will be used for course readings. These are available online through e-reserves. You can access them on Avenue under the e-reserves module.
