## [Chatbot Design](http://cfwelch.com/botdesign/login)
This is a website I built to introduce students to dialog systems and coding, allowing them to create a chatbot they can talk to with a custom scripting language. This has been used in presentations at [Xplore Engineering](https://campsforkids.engin.umich.edu/xplore/), [Girls Encoded](https://girlsencoded.eecs.umich.edu/), [UT Girl Day](https://girlday.utexas.edu/), [CS Kickstart](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/cskickstart/home), and other events primarily targeting high-school students.
