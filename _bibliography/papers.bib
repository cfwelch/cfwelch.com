  abstract={In this paper, we find a novel algorithm that can identify large localizable regions within a wireless sensor network. This algorithm is based on graph rigidity. We find a new technique to annex localizable subgraphs to other localizable subgraphs, thus expanding the localization. We simulate the results on wireless sensor graphs of various topologies. Our results indicate that we are able to localize almost all nodes in wireless sensor networks of various radii. Using MDS-MAP techniques in conjuction with this algorithm, wireless sensor networks can be localized with very small number of anchor nodes.},

  abstract={Image classification is an essential problem for content based image retrieval and image processing. Visual properties can be extracted from images in the form of MPEG-7 descriptors. Statistical methods can use these properties as features and be used to derive an effective method of classifying images by evaluating a minimal number of properties used in the MPEG-7 descriptor. Classification by artist, artistic movement, and indoor/outdoor setting is examined using J48, J48 graft, best first, functional, and least absolute deviation tree algorithms. An improved accuracy of 11% in classification of artist and 17% in classification of artistic movement over previous work is achieved using functional trees. In addition classification by indoor/outdoor setting shows that the method can be applied to new categories. We present an analysis of generated decision trees that shows edge histogram information is most prominent in classification of artists and artistic movements, while scalable color information is most useful for classification of indoor/outdoor setting.},

We look at three types of knowledge from (1) WordNet hypernyms and super senses,(2) Wikipedia entity links, and (3) retraining a named entity recognizer to identify concepts in AMR. The retrained entity recognizer is not perfect and cannot recognize all concepts in AMR and we examine the limitations of the named entity features using a set of oracles. The oracles show how performance increases if it can recognize different subsets of AMR concepts. These results show improvement on multiple fine-grained metrics, including a 6% increase in named entity F-score, and provide insight into the potential of world knowledge for future work in Abstract Meaning Representation parsing.},

Through a set of comparative experiments, we show that the system that incorporates these strategies performs better in the reflection generation task than a system that is just fine-tuned with counseling conversations. To confirm our findings, we present a human evaluation study that shows that our system generates naturally-looking reflections that are also stylistically and grammatically correct.},

How should we train a language model in this scenario? Most language modeling research considers either a small dataset with a closed vocabulary (like the standard 1 million token Penn Treebank), or the whole web with byte-pair encoding. We show that for our target setting in English, initialising and freezing input embeddings using in-domain data can improve language model performance by providing a useful representation of rare words, and this pattern holds across several different domains. In the process, we show that the standard convention of tying input and output embeddings does not improve perplexity when initializing with embeddings trained on in-domain data.},

We propose a new form of personalized word embeddings that use demographic-specific word representations derived compositionally from full or partial demographic information for a user (i.e., gender, age, location, religion). We show that the resulting demographic-aware word representations outperform generic word representations on two tasks for English: language modeling and word associations. We further explore the trade-off between the number of available attributes and their relative effectiveness and discuss the ethical implications of using them.},

First, we show that a classifier can distinguish between these two groups, indicating that their language use does in fact differ. To understand this difference, we perform several analyses addressing engagement aspects, including whether their comments engage the support-seeker further as well as linguistic aspects, such as dominant language and linguistic style matching. Our work contributes toward the developing efforts of understanding how health experts engage with health information- and support-seekers in social networks. More broadly, it is a step toward a deeper understanding of the styles of interactions that cultivate supportive engagement in online communities.},

  abstract={We introduce the problem of proficiency modeling: Given a user's posts on a social media platform, the task is to identify the subset of posts or topics for which the user has some level of proficiency. This enables the filtering and ranking of social media posts on a given topic as per user proficiency. Unlike experts on a given topic, proficient users may not have received formal training and possess years of practical experience, but may be autodidacts, hobbyists, and people with sustained interest, enabling them to make genuine and original contributions to discourse. While predicting whether a user is an expert on a given topic imposes strong constraints on who is a true positive, proficiency modeling implies a graded scoring, relaxing these constraints. Put another way, many active social media users can be assumed to possess, or eventually acquire, some level of proficiency on topics relevant to their community. We tackle proficiency modeling in an unsupervised manner by utilizing user embeddings to model engagement with a given topic, as indicated by a user's preference for authoring related content. We investigate five alternative approaches to model proficiency, ranging from basic ones to an advanced, tailored user modeling approach, applied within two real-world benchmarks for evaluation.},

We construct and evaluate an architecture for this purpose, using corpora annotated for politeness, formality, and toxicity. Through extensive experiments and human evaluation we demonstrate the potential of our method to generate text while controlling style. We find that style-specific datastores improve generation performance, though results vary greatly across styles, and the effect of pretraining data and specific styles should be explored in future work.},

We find we are able to dramatically reduce the size of fine-tuning data to 7.5-30k samples while at the same time making significant improvements over state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation of up to 3.4\% absolute reduction (26\% relative) from the original work on 2.3m samples, by strategically sampling data based on empathy scores. We observe that the degree of improvements is subject to specific communication components of empathy. In particular, the more cognitive components of empathy significantly beat the original dataset in almost all experiments, while emotional empathy was tied to less improvement and even underperforming random samples of the original data. This is a particularly implicative insight for NLP work concerning empathy as until recently the research and resources built for it have exclusively considered empathy as an emotional concept.},

  abstract={Personalized language models are designed and trained to capture language patterns specific to individual users. This makes them more accurate at predicting what a user will write. However, when a new user joins a platform and not enough text is available, it is harder to build effective personalized language models. We propose a solution for this problem, using a model trained on users that are similar to a new user. In this paper, we explore strategies for finding the similarity between new users and existing ones and methods for using the data from existing users who are a good match. We further explore the trade-off between available data for new users and how well their language can be modeled.},

We propose a pipeline that collects domain knowledge through web mining, and show that retrieval from both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge bases improves the quality of generated responses. We also present a model that incorporates knowledge generated by COMET using soft positional encoding and masked self-attention.
We show that both retrieved and COMET-generated knowledge improve the system's performance as measured by automatic metrics and also by human evaluation. Lastly, we present a comparative study on the types of knowledge encoded by our system showing that \textit{causal} and \textit{intentional} relationships benefit the generation task more than other types of commonsense relations.},

  abstract={Expressive writing and motivational interviewing are well-known approaches to help patients cope with stressful life events. While these methods are often applied by human counselors, it is less well understood if an automated AI approach can benefit patients. Providing an automated method would help expose a wider range of people to the possible benefits of motivational interviewing, with lower cost and more adaptability to sudden events like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study presents an automated writing system and evaluates possible outcomes among participants with respect to behavior related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants exhibited short term positive changes in mental health, but not long-term, and some linguistic metrics of writing style were correlated with positive change in behavior. While there were no significant long-term effects observed, the positive short term effect suggests that the Expressive Interviewing intervention could be used in cases where a patient lacks access to traditional therapy and needs a short-term solution.},

This paper investigates the challenges and risks of using GPT-3-based models for medical question-answering (MedQA). We perform several evaluations contextualized in terms of standard medical principles. We provide a procedure for manually designing patient queries to stress-test high-risk limitations of LLMs in MedQA systems. Our analysis shows that the LLMs fail to respond safely to these queries, producing invalid medical information, dangerous recommendations, and offensive content.},

The addition of locality levels allows a model to learn how to weight neighbors based on their relative location to the current text in source documents, and have been shown to further improve model performance. Nearest neighbor models have been explored for controllable generation but have not examined the use of locality levels. We present a novel approach for this purpose and evaluate it using automatic and human evaluation on politeness, formality, supportiveness, and toxicity textual data. We find that our model is successfully able to control style and provides a better fluency-style trade-off than previous work.},

However, a systematic analysis of the effect of multilingual training on bias mitigation and the impact of other factors, such as scaling the method for LLMs or equal distribution of training data, is lacking. To address this gap, we trained and evaluated new large-scale multilingual and monolingual models across five European languages (English, German, French, Italian and Spanish). For a systematic comparison, we use six newly trained LLMs consistent in size (2.6B) and architecture; one monolingual model for each of the five selected European languages and a multilingual one with equally distributed data proportion across those languages, trained on publicly available data only. For evaluation, we automatically translated standard bias benchmarks to these five languages and in each language manually verified the translation quality and the bias preservation by independent annotators. We experimentally show that our bias mitigation hypothesis holds consistently. Furthermore, we find that multilingual models show not only less bias but also higher prediction accuracy with the same amount of training data and model architecture and size. We make both the novel multilingual bias benchmarks and the trained models publicly available.},

  abstract={Although language model performance across diverse tasks continues to improve, these models still struggle to understand and explain the beliefs of other people. This skill requires perspective-taking, the process of conceptualizing the point of view of another person. Perspective taking becomes challenging when the text reflects more personal and potentially more controversial beliefs. We explore this task through natural language generation of responses to conflict situations. We evaluate novel modifications to recent architectures for conditioning generation on an individual's comments and self-disclosure statements. Our work extends the Social-Chem-101 corpus, using 95k judgements written by 6k authors from English Reddit data, for each of whom we obtained 20-500 self-disclosure statements. Our evaluation methodology borrows ideas from both personalized generation and theory of mind literature. Our proposed perspective-taking models outperform recent work, especially the twin encoder model conditioned on self-disclosures with high similarity to the conflict situation.},

These differences in language use also vary in expression across individuals, making it important to consider personal factors in unreliable news detection. The application of personalization methods for this has been made possible by recent publication of datasets with user histories, though this area is still largely unexplored. In this paper we present approaches to represent social media users in order to improve performance on three tasks: (1) classification of unreliable news posts, (2) classification of unreliable news spreaders, and, (3) prediction of the spread of unreliable news. We compare the User2Vec method from previous work to two other approaches; a learnable user embedding layer trained with the downstream task, and a representation derived from an authorship attribution classifier. We demonstrate that the implemented strategies substantially improve classification performance over state-of-the-art and provide initial results on the task of unreliable news prediction.},

  abstract={Recent trends in natural language processing research and annotation tasks affirm a paradigm shift from the traditional reliance on a single ground truth to a focus on individual perspectives, particularly in subjective tasks. In scenarios where annotation tasks are meant to encompass diversity, models that solely rely on the majority class labels may inadvertently disregard valuable minority perspectives. This oversight could result in the omission of crucial information and, in a broader context, risk disrupting the balance within larger ecosystems. As the landscape of annotator modeling unfolds with diverse representation techniques, it becomes imperative to investigate their effectiveness with the fine-grained features of the datasets in view. This study systematically explores various annotator modeling techniques and compares their performance across seven corpora. From our findings, we show that the commonly used user token model consistently outperforms more complex models. We introduce a composite embedding approach and show distinct differences in which model performs best as a function of the agreement with a given dataset. Our findings shed light on the relationship between corpus statistics and annotator modeling performance, which informs future work on corpus construction and perspectivist NLP.},

  abstract={We introduce an innovative annotation approach that draws on well-established frameworks for clinical empathy and breaking bad news (BBN) conversations. Empathy is essential in healthcare communication and requires considering the interactive dynamics of discourse relations. We constructed Empathy in BBNs, a dataset of simulated BBN conversations in German, annotated with our novel annotation scheme in collaboration with a large medical school to support research on educational tools for medical didactics. The dataset contains conversations between medical students and standardized patients and fine-grained annotations of the components of empathic interactions. We provide a detailed description of our span and relation labeling annotation procedure, where two trained annotators obtained Krippendorffâ€™s alpha agreement of â‰¥ 0.85. The annotation is based on 1) Pounds (2011)â€™s appraisal framework (AF) for clinical empathy, which is grounded in systemic functional linguistics, and 2) SPIKES protocol for breaking bad news (Baile et al., 2000) commonly taught in medical didactics training. This approach presents novel opportunities to study clinical empathic behavior and enables the training of models to detect causal relations involving empathy, a highly desirable feature of systems that can provide feedback to medical professionals in training. We present illustrative examples and discuss applications of annotation scheme and insights we can draw from the framework},

However, combining explainable theory with modern data-driven language modeling approaches is non-trivial. Here, we propose and evaluate methods for identifying language patterns indicative of suicide risk by combining theory-driven suicidal archetypes with language model-based and relative entropy-based approaches. Archetypes are based on prototypical statements that evince risk of suicidality while relative entropy considers the difference between how probable the risk-familiar and risk-unfamiliar models find user language. Each approach performed well individually; combining the two strikingly improved performance, yielding our combined system submission with a BERTScore Recall of 0.906. Further, we find diagnostic language is distributed unevenly in posts, with titles containing substantial risk evidence. We conclude that a union between theory- and data-driven methods is beneficial, outperforming more modern prompt-based methods.},

We study (1) the dimensionality of empathy definitions, (2) the correspondence between the defined dimensions and measured/observed properties, and (3) the conduciveness of the data to represent them, finding they have a significant impact to performance compared to other transfer setting features. Characterizing the theoretical grounding of empathy tasks as direct, abstract, or adjacent further indicates that tasks that directly predict specified empathy components have higher transferability. Our work provides empirical evidence for the need for precise and multidimensional empathy operationalizations.},

We identified prototypical annotators, with persona features that show varying degrees of alignment with the original human annotators. Within the data perspectivism paradigm, annotator modeling techniques that do not explicitly rely on annotator information performed better under weak data perspectivism compared to both strong data perspectivism and human annotations, suggesting LLM-generated views tend towards aggregation despite subjective prompting.

Although interviews are widely used to support human-centered innovation, evaluating their quality, especially from a cognitive perspective, remains underexplored. This study introduces a structured framework for evaluating interview quality in the context of Design Thinking, using Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy as a foundation. We propose the Cognitive Interview Quality Score, a composite metric that integrates three dimensions: Effectiveness, Bloom Coverage, and Distribution Balance Score. Using human-annotations, we assessed 15 interviews across three domains to measure cognitive diversity and structure. We compared CIQS-based rankings with human experts and found that the Bloom Coverage Score aligned more closely with expert judgments. We evaluated the performance of LMA-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini, using zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting, finding GPT-4o-mini, especially in zero-shot mode, showed the highest correlation with human annotations in all domains. Error analysis revealed that models struggled more with mid-level cognitive tasks (e.g., Apply, Analyze) and performed better on Create, likely due to clearer linguistic cues. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of using NLP models for automated cognitive classification and underscore the importance of combining cognitive metrics with qualitative insights to comprehensively assess interview quality."
