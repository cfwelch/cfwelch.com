  abstract={In this paper, we find a novel algorithm that can identify large localizable regions within a wireless sensor network. This algorithm is based on graph rigidity. We find a new technique to annex localizable subgraphs to other localizable subgraphs, thus expanding the localization. We simulate the results on wireless sensor graphs of various topologies. Our results indicate that we are able to localize almost all nodes in wireless sensor networks of various radii. Using MDS-MAP techniques in conjuction with this algorithm, wireless sensor networks can be localized with very small number of anchor nodes.},

  abstract={Image classification is an essential problem for content based image retrieval and image processing. Visual properties can be extracted from images in the form of MPEG-7 descriptors. Statistical methods can use these properties as features and be used to derive an effective method of classifying images by evaluating a minimal number of properties used in the MPEG-7 descriptor. Classification by artist, artistic movement, and indoor/outdoor setting is examined using J48, J48 graft, best first, functional, and least absolute deviation tree algorithms. An improved accuracy of 11% in classification of artist and 17% in classification of artistic movement over previous work is achieved using functional trees. In addition classification by indoor/outdoor setting shows that the method can be applied to new categories. We present an analysis of generated decision trees that shows edge histogram information is most prominent in classification of artists and artistic movements, while scalable color information is most useful for classification of indoor/outdoor setting.},

We look at three types of knowledge from (1) WordNet hypernyms and super senses,(2) Wikipedia entity links, and (3) retraining a named entity recognizer to identify concepts in AMR. The retrained entity recognizer is not perfect and cannot recognize all concepts in AMR and we examine the limitations of the named entity features using a set of oracles. The oracles show how performance increases if it can recognize different subsets of AMR concepts. These results show improvement on multiple fine-grained metrics, including a 6% increase in named entity F-score, and provide insight into the potential of world knowledge for future work in Abstract Meaning Representation parsing.},

In addition to the content of the messages, we examine conversational aspects such as the time messages are sent, messaging frequency, psycholinguistic word categories, linguistic mirroring, and graph-based features reflecting how people in the corpus mention each other.

Through a set of comparative experiments, we show that the system that incorporates these strategies performs better in the reflection generation task than a system that is just fine-tuned with counseling conversations. To confirm our findings, we present a human evaluation study that shows that our system generates naturally-looking reflections that are also stylistically and grammatically correct.},

How should we train a language model in this scenario? Most language modeling research considers either a small dataset with a closed vocabulary (like the standard 1 million token Penn Treebank), or the whole web with byte-pair encoding. We show that for our target setting in English, initialising and freezing input embeddings using in-domain data can improve language model performance by providing a useful representation of rare words, and this pattern holds across several different domains. In the process, we show that the standard convention of tying input and output embeddings does not improve perplexity when initializing with embeddings trained on in-domain data.},

We propose a new form of personalized word embeddings that use demographic-specific word representations derived compositionally from full or partial demographic information for a user (i.e., gender, age, location, religion). We show that the resulting demographic-aware word representations outperform generic word representations on two tasks for English: language modeling and word associations. We further explore the trade-off between the number of available attributes and their relative effectiveness and discuss the ethical implications of using them.},

First, we show that a classifier can distinguish between these two groups, indicating that their language use does in fact differ. To understand this difference, we perform several analyses addressing engagement aspects, including whether their comments engage the support-seeker further as well as linguistic aspects, such as dominant language and linguistic style matching. Our work contributes toward the developing efforts of understanding how health experts engage with health information- and support-seekers in social networks. More broadly, it is a step toward a deeper understanding of the styles of interactions that cultivate supportive engagement in online communities.},

  abstract={We introduce the problem of proficiency modeling: Given a user's posts on a social media platform, the task is to identify the subset of posts or topics for which the user has some level of proficiency. This enables the filtering and ranking of social media posts on a given topic as per user proficiency. Unlike experts on a given topic, proficient users may not have received formal training and possess years of practical experience, but may be autodidacts, hobbyists, and people with sustained interest, enabling them to make genuine and original contributions to discourse. While predicting whether a user is an expert on a given topic imposes strong constraints on who is a true positive, proficiency modeling implies a graded scoring, relaxing these constraints. Put another way, many active social media users can be assumed to possess, or eventually acquire, some level of proficiency on topics relevant to their community. We tackle proficiency modeling in an unsupervised manner by utilizing user embeddings to model engagement with a given topic, as indicated by a user's preference for authoring related content. We investigate five alternative approaches to model proficiency, ranging from basic ones to an advanced, tailored user modeling approach, applied within two real-world benchmarks for evaluation.},

Through extensive experiments and human evaluation we demonstrate the potential of our method to generate text while controlling style. We find that style-specific datastores improve generation performance, though results vary greatly across styles, and the effect of pretraining data and specific styles should be explored in future work.},

Using empathetic data, we improve over recent work on controllable text generation that aims to reduce the toxicity of generated text. We find we are able to dramatically reduce the size of fine-tuning data to 7.5-30k samples while at the same time making significant improvements over state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation of up to 3.4\% absolute reduction (26\% relative) from the original work on 2.3m samples, by strategically sampling data based on empathy scores. We observe that the degree of improvements is subject to specific communication components of empathy. In particular, the more cognitive components of empathy significantly beat the original dataset in almost all experiments, while emotional empathy was tied to less improvement and even underperforming random samples of the original data. This is a particularly implicative insight for NLP work concerning empathy as until recently the research and resources built for it have exclusively considered empathy as an emotional concept.},

  abstract={Personalized language models are designed and trained to capture language patterns specific to individual users. This makes them more accurate at predicting what a user will write. However, when a new user joins a platform and not enough text is available, it is harder to build effective personalized language models. We propose a solution for this problem, using a model trained on users that are similar to a new user. In this paper, we explore strategies for finding the similarity between new users and existing ones and methods for using the data from existing users who are a good match. We further explore the trade-off between available data for new users and how well their language can be modeled.},

  abstract={In this paper, we study the effect of commonsense and domain knowledge while generating responses in counseling conversations using retrieval and generative methods for knowledge integration. We propose a pipeline that collects domain knowledge through web mining, and show that retrieval from both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge bases improves the quality of generated responses. We also present a model that incorporates knowledge generated by COMET using soft positional encoding and masked self-attention.
We show that both retrieved and COMET-generated knowledge improve the system's performance as measured by automatic metrics and also by human evaluation. Lastly, we present a comparative study on the types of knowledge encoded by our system showing that \textit{causal} and \textit{intentional} relationships benefit the generation task more than other types of commonsense relations.},

  abstract={Expressive writing and motivational interviewing are well-known approaches to help patients cope with stressful life events. While these methods are often applied by human counselors, it is less well understood if an automated AI approach can benefit patients. Providing an automated method would help expose a wider range of people to the possible benefits of motivational interviewing, with lower cost and more adaptability to sudden events like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study presents an automated writing system and evaluates possible outcomes among participants with respect to behavior related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants exhibited short term positive changes in mental health, but not long-term, and some linguistic metrics of writing style were correlated with positive change in behavior. While there were no significant long-term effects observed, the positive short term effect suggests that the Expressive Interviewing intervention could be used in cases where a patient lacks access to traditional therapy and needs a short-term solution.},

  abstract={This research contributes to the task of predicting empathy and personality traits within dialogue, an important aspect of natural language processing, as part of our experimental work for the WASSA 2023 Empathy and Emotion Shared Task. For predicting empathy, emotion polarity, and emotion intensity on turns within a dialogue, we employ adapters trained on social media interactions labeled with empathy ratings in a stacked composition with the target task adapters. Furthermore, we embed demographic information to predict Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) subscales and Big Five Personality Traits utilizing BERT-based models. The results from our study provide valuable insights, contributing to advancements in understanding human behavior and interaction through text. Our team ranked 2nd on the personality and empathy prediction tasks, 4th on the interpersonal reactivity index, and 6th on the conversational task.},

  abstract={The potential to provide patients with faster information access while allowing medical specialists to focus on urgent tasks makes medical domain dialog agents appealing. However, there can be dire consequences due to the limitations of large-language models (LLMs) built into such agents. This paper investigates the challenges and risks of using GPT-3-based models for medical question-answering (MedQA). We perform several evaluations contextualized in terms of standard medical principles. We provide a procedure for manually designing patient queries to stress-test high-risk limitations of LLMs in MedQA systems. Our analysis shows that the LLMs fail to respond safely to these queries, producing invalid medical information, dangerous recommendations, and offensive content.},

  abstract={Recent language models have been improved by the addition of external memory. Nearest neighbor language models retrieve similar contexts to assist in word prediction. The addition of locality levels allows a model to learn how to weight neighbors based on their relative location to the current text in source documents, and have been shown to further improve model performance. Nearest neighbor models have been explored for controllable generation but have not examined the use of locality levels. We present a novel approach for this purpose and evaluate it using automatic and human evaluation on politeness, formality, supportiveness, and toxicity textual data. We find that our model is successfully able to control style and provides a better fluency-style trade-off than previous work.},
